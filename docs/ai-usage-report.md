# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT

## How I Used AI
I used AI mainly to speed up the development of my portfolio project. It helped me generate the initial structure for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I also asked for examples of responsive design (using CSS Grid) and simple interactive features like a greeting message and smooth scrolling. In addition, I used it for guidance on writing the README and technical documentation becaues I have never wrote a .md file.

## Benefits
- Saved time by quickly generating starter code and file structure.
- Helped me understand how to apply responsive design and interactivity.
- Provided suggestions for improving layout and styling.

## Challenges
- Some of the AI suggestions were more complex than needed for my project, so I had to simplify them.
- I needed to double-check the code to make sure it matched the assignment requirements.

## Learning Outcomes
- I learned how to structure a small web project with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- I practiced modifying AI-generated code instead of just copying it, which improved my understanding.
- I became more comfortable using AI as a supportive tool rather than relying on it completely.
